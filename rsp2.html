            <h3>RS3</h3>
            <p>Details for the RS 3 Sportback were revealed in December 2014.[32] It went on sale in the first quarter of 2015 
                and featured a 2.5 litres (2,480 cc) straight-5 engine with 367 PS (270 kW; 362 hp) 
                and 465 N⋅m (343 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The RS 3 Sportback had a seven speed S tronic
                 transmission and quattro all-wheel drive system which helped propel the car to 100 km/h 
                 (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds. The RS 3 Sportback out-performs the BMW M2 & Mercedes-Benz A45 AMG 
                 in a straight line, thanks to Audi's quattro feature.[citation needed] Scott Keogh of Audi
                  of America said in April 2015 that he's "confident" we'll see the car come to the United States.
                  [58]

                    In April 2015, the new 2015 RS 3 Sportback was promoted in the UK by a controversial commercial portraying an Audi R8 "giving birth" to it.[59]
                    
                    Starting in 2017, a sedan model of the RS 3 was offered.
